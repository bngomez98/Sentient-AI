              American democracy is built on the principle of a government accountable to its people. When that
              connection weakens, the system ceases to function for the majority. This is the challenge we face today: a
              system that has become unresponsive to the needs of its citizens, requiring a fundamental reset.

                <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
                  Over decades, the priorities of Congress have shifted. Representatives now spend an inordinate amount
                  of time fundraising from a small pool of wealthy donors and special interests. This creates a system
                  where policy is shaped not by the needs of the American public, but by the priorities of those who can
                  fund campaigns.

                <p className="text-lg text-slate-700">
                  The result is a government that struggles to address critical issues affecting everyday Americansâ€”from
                  a national debt surpassing $34 trillion and soaring healthcare costs to crumbling infrastructure and
                  economic uncertainty. Its incentive structure is aligned with outside interests, not the public good.

                  Despite historically low approval ratings, incumbents are reelected over 95% of the time. This is not
                  a sign of public satisfaction. It is the result of a system designed to protect incumbents through
                  gerrymandered districts and enormous fundraising advantages.

                  This "self-preservation loop" prevents new ideas and new leaders from emerging, ensuring that the

                  When a government fails to solve the real-world problems of its citizens, it creates a dangerous void.
                  People's legitimate frustration becomes a powerful political force. Extremist movements exploit this
                  energy by offering radical, anti-democratic solutions.

                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                  Detailed plans like Project 2025 are designed to capitalize on this very moment. They propose to
                  dismantle democratic checks and balances, politicize the civil service, and centralize executive
                  power, effectively replacing our system of government with one based on authoritarian control.

                  The solution must be as fundamental as the problem. It cannot be a minor reform or a shift in partisan
                  control. It must be a complete reset of the institution itself.
